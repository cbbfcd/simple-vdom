# vdom

⚠️ This library is just a simple case of learning virtual dom technology and does not have the ability to practice in a production environment.

There are a lot of articles and code implementations for virtual doms. 

This library mainly refers to the implementation in [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/blob/V2/README.md), based on the ability of [waltjs](https://github.com/ballercat/walt) to give it webassmbly.

This is an attempt. Does the implementation of the diff algorithm with [webassembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/WebAssembly) lead to a significant performance boost?

so, just fork or clone this repo and build it better via a PR. thanks! happy new year!
